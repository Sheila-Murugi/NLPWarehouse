# Scalable Data Warehouse for LLM Finetuning: API Design for High Throughput Data Ingestion and RAG Retrieval

## Overview

Roots Tech Solutions is enhancing its Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for multiple African languages, particularly Swahili, Yoruba, and Amharic. This project aims to develop a comprehensive data corpus to support various NLP applications, such as semantic search, content generation, chatbot support, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.

## Business Objective

The goal is to accurately process and understand Swahili, Yoruba, and Amharic text/audio to develop innovative and competitive products. By collecting high-quality text/audio datasets from diverse online sources, Roots Tech Solutions can overcome the current lack of extensive datasets for these languages.

## Project Design

The project is divided into several stages:
1. **Data Collection and Storage**: Web scraping and storing raw data.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning, preprocessing, and annotating the collected data.
3. **API Development**: Creating APIs for data access.
4. **Automation**: Setting up an automated pipeline for continuous data handling.
5. **Monitoring**: Using tools like Prometheus and Grafana for performance tracking.

## Tech-Stack Used

- **Web Scraping**: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript (React)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- **API Frameworks**: Flask, FastAPI
- **Automation**: Apache Airflow, Docker, Docker Compose
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

## Methodologies Followed

1. **Data Collection**: Using Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium to scrape data from various online sources.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and preprocessing text data to ensure quality.
3. **API Development**: Developing RESTful APIs with Flask and FastAPI for data access.
4. **Automation**: Using Apache Airflow for workflow automation and Docker for containerization.
5. **Monitoring**: Implementing Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the pipeline.

## Challenges Faced

- Identifying and extracting high-quality data from diverse sources.
- Ensuring the accuracy and relevance of collected data.
- Handling large-scale data efficiently through APIs.
- Automating the entire pipeline to handle continuous data ingestion and processing.

## Results Obtained

- Successfully developed scripts for web scraping and data cleaning.
- Designed a database schema and stored the processed data.
- Implemented APIs for easy data access and interaction.
- Automated the data processing pipeline for continuous data handling.

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of robust data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- Effective use of automation tools like Apache Airflow and Docker.
- Significance of monitoring tools for maintaining pipeline performance.

## Limitations and Future Plans

- **Limitations**: Handling multilingual data and ensuring consistent data quality.
- **Future Plans**: 
  - Expanding the data corpus to include more African languages.
  - Enhancing the API capabilities for more complex queries.
  - Improving the automation pipeline for better efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- Docker

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scalable-data-warehouse.git
   cd scalable-data-warehouse
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment:
   ```bash
